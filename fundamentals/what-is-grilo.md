# ðŸ’Ž What is GRILO?

GRILO attempts to simulate the second-stage bootloader usually found in your computer's hard drive. It simulates the multiple booting choices to allow you to boot to different applications. It also simulates the booting process by executing the .NET assembly that implements the `IBootable` interface.

The bootloader interacts with your keyboard to give the users a chance to select their operating system to be booted. GRILO simulates this.

For example, Kernel Simulator makes use of the GRILO boot interface to define itself as a bootable .NET assembly.

GRILO is a portmanteau of both the GRUB and LILO bootloaders, which are the major Linux bootloaders.
