# ðŸŽ† API v2.0 series

We've established the GRILO application to make our own bootloader simulator for your bootable console applications made in .NET. However, this API series comes along to renew everything.

### Version 1.0.0

This version is still work in progress, although you can now test the version in beta versions. The below changes will be populated once the beta ends.

We promise that we'll implement several amazing features during the beta periods. If you found any issues or suggestions, report them on GitHub, and we'll consider responding to your requests within the next 24 hours.
