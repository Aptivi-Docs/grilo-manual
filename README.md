{% hint style="info" %}
GRILO will be merged with Nitrocid KS 0.1.1, which is going to be released in the future. Once this version of N-KS is released, this manual will be merged with Nitrocid's manual and the entire project will be deprecated. Meanwhile, there will be no updates to GRILO.
{% endhint %}

GRILO is a bootloader simulator that can execute any .NET console application supported by the GRILO interface. It simulates the boot process of GRUB/LILO by showing the boot menu and displaying pre-boot messages.

It's just a simulator, so you can't boot this bootloader from your real computer; it's just like any other application installed on your computer that **simulates** how the bootloader works.
