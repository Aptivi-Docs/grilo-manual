GRILO is a bootloader simulator that can execute any .NET console application supported by the GRILO interface. It simulates the boot process of GRUB/LILO by showing the boot menu and displaying pre-boot messages.

It's just a simulator, so you can't boot this bootloader from your real computer; it's just like any other application installed on your computer that **simulates** how the bootloader works.
