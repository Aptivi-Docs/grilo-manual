# ðŸ–¥ Windows

There are separate versions of GRILO: the version which runs .NET Framework 4.8 bootable applications and versions that run from .NET 6.0 to .NET 8.0.

Before performing the installation, your Windows system must meet the following requirements:

| System     | Framework                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Terminal                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 7+ | [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0), [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0), or [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) | [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) or Windows 10 cmd.exe |

We advice you to use the terminal emulation software capable of displaying the VT sequences on systems older than Windows 10. GRILO is currently not color-heavy, but will be in the future.
